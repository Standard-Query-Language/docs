# Standard Query Language (SQLY)

**SQLY** is a YAML-based query language inspired by JQL, Kusto, and DQL. It is designed for querying structured and semi-structured data efficiently.

## ðŸ“– Specification Overview

### ðŸ”¹ [Basics](basics.md)

Learn how to write simple SQLY queries, including `select`, `from`, `where`, `order_by`, and `group_by`.

### ðŸ”¹ [Advanced Features](advanced_features.md)

Explore complex filtering, logical operators, sorting, and aggregations.

### ðŸ”¹ [Subqueries](subqueries.md)

Use subqueries to fetch results dynamically within a query.

### ðŸ”¹ [Common Table Expressions (CTEs)](ctes.md)

Utilize CTEs to structure queries for better readability and performance.

### ðŸ”¹ [Window Functions](window_functions.md)

Perform ranking, running totals, and moving averages using window functions.

### ðŸ”¹ [Recursive Queries](recursive_queries.md)

Handle hierarchical data, such as employee relationships or category trees.

### ðŸ”¹ [Full-text Search](full_text_search.md)

Perform fuzzy searches and text matching in large datasets.

### ðŸ”¹ [Geospatial Queries](geospatial_queries.md)

Work with geospatial data to find points within a radius, bounding boxes, and distances.

### ðŸ”¹ [Machine Learning](machine_learning.md)

Integrate predictive models for forecasting and anomaly detection within queries.

### ðŸ”¹ [JSON & Arrays](json_arrays.md)

Filter and manipulate JSON fields and array data types.

### ðŸ”¹ [User-defined Functions (UDFs)](user_defined_functions.md)

Define and use custom functions to extend SQLYâ€™s capabilities.

### ðŸ”¹ [Performance Optimization](performance.md)

Learn techniques to optimize query execution and improve efficiency.

### ðŸ”¹ [Advanced Debugging](debugging.md)

Enable query tracing, logging, and error handling for efficient debugging.

### ðŸ”¹ [SQLY Extensions](extensions.md)

Explore custom functions, external data sources, and event-driven triggers.
